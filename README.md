## Installation Guide

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyeshaFerdous/athleon.git
cd athleon
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

To configure the backend services like Firebase and MongoDB, you'll need to set up environment variables. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following:

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
```

Make sure to replace your-* with actual credentials from your Firebase project.

### 4. Run the project

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured, you can run the project locally using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser. You can now begin working with the Roomify Platform locally.

## ðŸ”§ Backend Setup (Optional)

If you want to set up the backend locally for testing purposes:

1. Navigate to the server directory (if applicable).
2. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following credentials:

```bash
MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
```


4. Start the backend server:

```bash

```

Your backend will now be running, and you can test the API along with the frontend.
